            <p class="subhead">Stories from the Berkeley Historical Society and Museum's exhibit on Berkeley residents of Japanese descent sent to internment camps during World War II.</p>

        <div class="byline">
            <p>By <a href="https://github.com/JamesJWilde2">James Wilde</a> | July 17, 2025</p>
        </div>
    <p>About a month ago, I stumbled upon <a href="https://berkhistory.org/japanese-americans-in-berkeley-here-lived-map/">a map</a> of every person of Japanese descent taken from Berkeley, California in 1942 and imprisoned in concentration camps. 
      In all, 1,151 Berkeley residents were forced to pack up their lives and board buses to go live in overcrowded barracks for years during World War II.</p>

    <p>The map, which is part of an exhibit from the Berkeley Historical Society and Museum on the history of Japanese Americans in the city, comes from a database created by BHSM member Michael Several. 
      Drawing inspiration from the “<a href="https://berkhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/Description-of-Here-Lived-Michael-Several-1.pdf">stumbling stones</a>” across Europe that commemorate the homes of those killed by the Nazis, Several documented every person of Japanese descent forced to leave Berkeley. 
      Elina Juvonen, a U.C. Santa Cruz graduate who grew up in Berkeley, then used Several’s database to create an <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1-j005UQ_QilvnWQhawqeoRKdFlRMZ14&femb=1&ll=37.87133009513296%2C-122.27946312683106&z=13">interactive “Here Lived” map</a>.</p>

    <p>After spending hours browsing the map and database, I decided to highlight a few of the stories I came across.</p>

        <div class="scrolly-overlay">
          <div class="step" id="step1">
            <p>In April 1942, most of the nearly 1,200 people of Japanese descent living in Berkeley were sent on buses, first to the Tanforan detention center in San Bruno, California, and later to the Topaz concentration camp in Utah.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" id="step2">
            <p>Yoshiko Uchida was a 21-year-old university student when imprisoned. Uchida and her family were <a href="https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Yoshiko_Uchida/#Books_for_Children_and_Young_Adults_by_Yoshiko_Uchida">initially sent to Tanforan</a>, where they lived in a horse stall. Uchida worked as a teacher in both Tanforan and Topaz, and later became a writer, authoring around 30 children’s books as well as a memoir of her time in camp. She wrote of her time incarcerated: “I caught one cold after another; I fell on the unpaved roads; I lost my voice from the dust; I got homesick and angry and despondent. And sometimes I cried.” </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" id="step3">
            <p>Saku Moriwaki was a 31-year-old music teacher when imprisoned. Moriwaki and her sister were <a href="http://oac-upstream.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft2489n723/?&brand=oac4">among the first families</a> to leave Topaz for Palo Alto, California. Her husband, Yoshiaki Moriwaki, (formerly an insurance broker) joined the war to fight the Nazis.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" id="step4">
            <p>James Shigeo Hirano was a 38-year-old market manager when imprisoned. Hirano had a son, Dan, just after coming to Topaz. In <a href="https://topazstories.com/father-and-son/">a heartfelt memo</a> from 2018, Dan Hirano reflected on a photo in “a landscape that is both harsh and bleak” of him sitting in his father’s lap at Topaz: “Well, he even cuffed the left leg of his pants high so we could see his fine shoes. The man was vain, vain just like his son.”</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" id="step5">
            <p>Kurasaburo Fujii was a 61-year-old laundry worker when imprisoned. Fujii formed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a8_xgYx1nQKsKYB6Pyu_lipNGaivPvYV/view">a five-family Berkeley laundry cooperative</a> in 1914, and he and his wife, Kikuyo, had seven children. Their daughter, Michiko, married Ki Uchida in 1942, and the newlywed couple spent their honeymoon in a horse stall at Tanforan. Fifth generation members of the Fujii family still live in Berkeley today. A description of Kurasburo’s work read: “started the work day at 4:30 a.m. at the University Laundry, ate breakfast at 6 a.m. and delivered orders by horse and buggy.”</p>

      <div class="content"></div>
      <p>Each of the 1,151 Japanese Americans removed from Berkeley has a story, and the fragments described above barely scratch the surface of the whole.</p>

      <p>In total, around 120,000 people were put into what are often called “internment camps.” 
        However, <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1834&context=sjsj">modern scholars</a> have considered the term to be both inaccurate (because the international use of “internment” only refers to noncitizens, whereas most of the people sent to camps were citizens) and euphemistic. 
        There is still <a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/debate-over-words-to-describe-japanese-american-incarceration-lingers">debate</a> about the correct term to use, 
        but the U.S. government often referred to them as concentration camps during the war (including <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/publiceditor/2012/02/10/146691773/euphemisms-concentration-camps-and-the-japanese-internment">President Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>).</p>

      <p>In any case, nine of the 10 camps were shut down by the end of 1945. The war and the camps had come to an end, but the ramifications live on today.</p>
